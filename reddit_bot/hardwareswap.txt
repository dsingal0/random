I bought the 3090FE along with the eGPU to game while WFH, but we're going back in, so selling.    

3090 was bought in December, and used for ~2 months in eGPU. Thermal pads are Thermal Grizzly Minus Pad 8, installed by a friend at A7A Computers. Used for Overwatch and Data Science, NOT MINED WITH :|      

1080Ti was mined with for Winter in 2018 and 1 month in 2021 Winter. Other GPUs are unused if new, and not mined on if not.     

**all prices are local, for shipped multiply by 1.03 and add $40 per item**
